# OresStats
OreStats is a lightweight open source mod for Minecraft 1.10.2 that logs HiddenOre drops and stone breaks to {your minecraft directory}/OresStats.

These log files contain the biome, height, dimension, and tool used of every stone break and every HiddenOre drop that you get while you have logging enabled.

Log files are formatted as a series of JSON objects, separated by newlines. Although they are initially saved as .txt files, old ones are zipped to conserve space.

## How to install
Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/MudkipGuy/OresStats/releases/download/v1.0/OresStats-1.10.2-1.0.jar) and [install it the usual way](http://www.minecraftmods.com/how-to-install-mods-for-minecraft-forge/)

## Controls
By default, pressing "O" will toggle whether logging is enabled. This can be rebound in the controls menu.
